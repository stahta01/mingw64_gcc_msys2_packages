# mingw64_gcc_msys2_packages
GCC MinGW64 Msys2 packages for MINGW32 and MINGW64 environments.

Future plans include adding packages for the UCRT64 environment.

The primary goal of this project is to build GCC 4.6.4 with Ada for either the MINGW64 or MINGW32 environment.

A secondary goal is to build GCC 4.3.6 with Ada for the MINGW32 environment.

After the above goals are completed, building GCC 6.5.0 and 8.5.0 with Ada for both MINGW64 and MINGW32 environments will be the third goal.
