GCC build technique     How GCC Configure option compares
regular native              build==host==target
regular cross               build==host!=target
cross native                build!=host==target
canadian cross              build!=host!=target

When building MinGW64 GCC, in-tree GMP version 4.3.2 does not work with cross native build technique.

Note: in-tree GMP means the source for GMP is placed in the GCC source tree.

MinGW64 CRT 3.0 configure option "--host" is more like GCC "--target" instead of like GCC "--host".
